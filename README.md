<h1>Quick description</h1>
An old abandoned project with the implementation of a physical transport controller in Godot 4.3. 
It works with the help of raycasts made for each wheel. It can be used for four-wheeled vehicles, or for tracked systems.
The project is incomplete, but we can finish it or redo it for our projects. I publish according to your requests

<h1>Dependencies</h1>
* debug_draw_3d
* godot-jolt
